# Abstract
This paper presents ”Eco-Carbon”, a novel approach to personal carbon footprint calculation and reduction guidance, leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques.The main objective of the project is to create an integrated system that combines a personalized recommendation system with estimates of carbon emissions from electricity use and transportation. Information about personal travel habits and household electrical consumption has been gathered. For transportation emission computations, sophisticated machine learning models such as random forests and decision trees are being created, and the recommendation system is supported by collaborative filtering algorithms. According to preliminary findings, users are very interested in learning about and minimizing their carbon footprints, and machine learning methods appear to be promising in terms of precise emission estimation. Ensuring data quality and striking a balance between user data anonymity and personalized recommendations are challenges.
